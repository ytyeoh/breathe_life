We value the trust of those we deal with, and of the public, and recognise that maintaining this trust requires that we be transparent and accountable in how we treat the personal information that you choose to share with us.</p><p>During the course of our various activities, we frequently gather and use personal information. This information may be obtained directly from you or collected from third parties that have the right to disclose this information to us. Anyone from whom we collect such personal information should expect that it will be carefully protected and that any use of or other dealing with this personal information is subject to express or implied consent. Our privacy practices are designed to achieve this.</p><p>Depending on where you live, BreatheLife may not be under any statutory obligations with respect to the protection of the personal information that you provide to us. Notwithstanding such, BreatheLife has voluntarily decided to adhere to best practices for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information as outlined in this policy.</p><h2 id=defining-personal-information>Defining Personal Information</h2><p>Personal information is information about an identifiable individual. This includes any information that can be used to distinguish, identify or contact a specific individual. An individual’s opinions or beliefs, as well as facts about or related to the individual may also be considered personal information. Business contact information and certain publicly available information, such as names, addresses and telephone numbers as published in telephone directories, are not usually considered personal information.</p><p>Where an individual uses his or her home contact information as business contact information as well, we consider the contact information provided to be business contact information, and therefore may not be subject to the same level of protection as personal information.</p><h2 id=what-personal-information-do-we-collect>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2><p>Personal information collected by BreatheLife may include: name, address, telephone number(s), email address(es) and other contact information, date of birth, credit card or bank account information for sponsorship and/or donation purposes, countries or programmes an individual wishes to support, language preference, demographic information such as age and gender, and communication preferences for marketing purposes.</p><p>We also use “cookies” to track visits to our website; you can usually disable cookies in your internet browser settings. You can find out more about cookies by looking at our Terms of Use.</p><h2 id=privacy-practices>Privacy Practices</h2><p>Personal information gathered by our organisation is kept in confidence. Our personnel are authorised to access personal information based only on their need to deal with it for the reason(s) for which it was obtained. Safeguards are in place to ensure that personal information is not disclosed or shared more widely than is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was gathered. We contractually require any person or organisation providing services to BreatheLife to comply with privacy legislation. We also take measures to ensure that the integrity of personal information is maintained and retained only as long as it is required.</p><p>We collect, use and disclose personal information only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in light of the circumstances. We do not rent or sell personal information to any other organisation.</p><h2 id=how-do-we-use-your-personal-information>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h2><p>BreatheLife collects personal information in order to service your account, understand your giving preferences and provide you with relevant communications and marketing materials.</p><p>We might use your information for the following purposes:</p><ul><li>for the immediate reason for which you have given it: for example, to enable us to process your request (e.g. gift, payment, registration, subscription, change of details) including issuing you with a receipt</li><li>to maintain contact with you about our work: for example, report back to you about our work in the field, encourage you to learn about and act on poverty and justice issues, or let you know about other opportunities to give financially or what our partner organisations are doing (unless you have specifically asked us not to)</li><li>any other purpose related to our work</li></ul><p>We may share this information with BreatheLife employees for the purposes of marketing, research and analysis. In certain limited circumstances, personal information collected by BreatheLife (excluding financial information) may be stored or processed outside of Malaysia and therefore subject to the legal jurisdiction of those countries.</p><p>If we use personal information in ways other than as stated in this policy, we will ensure we comply with the legal requirements.</p><h2 id=when-do-we-disclose-your-personal-information>When Do We Disclose Your Personal Information?</h2><p>We do not disclose your personal information to other organisations except for purposes relating to our core business; importantly, we don’t rent, sell or exchange our supporter information.</p><p>Nonetheless, information about you might be given to:</p><ul><li>providers of services to us, for example: banking, payment card data processing, mail delivery and sorting (including electronic), telecommunications, information technology, information storage, market analysis or research, website usage analysis, legal, audit or accounting</li></ul><p>When this occurs, we provide only the information that is required to provide the services and strict terms of confidentiality are established. We take reasonable steps to make sure that our agreements with service providers include appropriate privacy and confidentiality obligations.</p><p>Occasionally we may use overseas/regional/international facilities or contractors to process or back up information or to provide other services. As a result, we may transfer your personal information to our overseas facilities or contractors for these purposes. However, any transfer of information does not change our commitment to safeguard your privacy.</p><h2 id=keeping-your-information-safe>Keeping Your Information Safe</h2><p>Our website uses secure response forms when we ask for your personal and payment card details and we work hard to keep your information secure by having safe systems in place. We commit to de-identifying or destroying your information where we no longer need to keep it.</p><p>We will take all reasonable steps to keep your information safe (whether electronically or in hard copies) and to keep it up to date. This includes complying with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which covers security of payment card information. Our employees and service providers use password protocols when accessing sensitive information and are expected to keep personal and payment card information confidential and secure.</p><h2 id=access-to-your-personal-information>Access to Your Personal Information</h2><p>If at any time you want to know what personal information we hold about you, please address your request to our Donor Care Officers. If you wish to have your personal information deleted, we will take reasonable steps to delete it unless we need to keep it for legal, auditing or internal risk management reasons.
If we use personal information in ways other than as stated in this policy, we will ensure we comply with the requirements of Privacy law.</p><h2 id=protecting-children-and-young-adults>Protecting Children and Young Adults</h2><p>If you are 18 or over, we will usually assume that you can make your own privacy decisions.
