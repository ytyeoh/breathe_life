    content: 'My heart broke every time I heard the sad stories of birthing refugees whohad attempted to give birth alone and outside of medical care. I could notbear the unnecessary pain and loss of these families. I felt compelled tobring change. I could use my training and experience and help to avoidmaternal and infant mortalities and bring HOPE and LOVING CARE to thesewomen and their families.I began to provide services on my own - one family at a time. Numbers grewand the impact of the ‘little I provided’ was greatly appreciated and broughtthe change I had hoped for. I began to partner with other service providers toincrease the assistance we could provide. In time a team of dedicatedvolunteers, each one bearing the same compassion and desire for change,formed.In order to meet the growing challenge, Breathe Life wasestablished. Empowered by support from people like yourself, Hope and Change can be inspired in the lives of thousands of needy families. '
