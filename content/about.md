    content: 'My <b>heart broke every time </b>I heard the sad stories of <b>birthing refugees </b>whohad attempted to give birth <b>alone</b> and <b>outside of medical care</b>. I could notbear the unnecessary pain and loss of these families. I <b>felt compelled</b> to <b>bring change</b>. I could use my training and experience and help to avoidmaternal and infant mortalities and bring <b>HOPE</b> and <b>LOVING CARE</b> to thesewomen and their families.I began to provide services on my own - one family at a time. Numbers grewand the impact of the ‘little I provided’ was greatly appreciated and <b>brought the change</b> I had hoped for. I began to partner with other service providers to <b>increase the assistance</b> we could provide. In time a team of dedicatedvolunteers, each one bearing the same compassion and desire for change,formed.In order to meet the growing challenge, Breathe Life wasestablished. <b>Empowered by support from people like yourself, Hope and Change can be inspired in the lives of thousands of needy families.</b> '
