# Terms of Use
## Our Commitment
BreatheLife is committed to protecting the privacy of the children and adults living in communities where we work. As part of this commitment, BreatheLife  prohibits the usage of child photos from our website (breathelife.org.my) on other personal or commercial websites.
 
## Tracking Your Use
We collect statistics on visitor traffic to our website through “cookies”. These are anonymous and do not identify you. We may also anonymously track your visit to our website by using information collected by others. For example, we use Google Analytics Demographics, which tells us things like gender, age range and interests of site visitors – without giving us any information that could be used to identify you. This enables us to better understand how our website is used and what you are interested in.
 
If you prefer not to allow this, you may be able to adjust your browser to turn off the use of “cookies” or notify you when they are being used. You can also opt out of programmes like Google Analytics if you wish (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). However, if you disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas to take advantage of certain features on our website.
 
## Protecting Your Information
To protect your personal and financial information, our site uses security encrypted response forms when personal and financial details are requested. The security we use between your browser and our website is 128-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. A security icon will be visible in the URL address box (e.g. a padlock). This confirms that your browser supports SSL security. Double click on the security icon to verify the security certificate on this website. You will then see a box which displays who the certificate is issued to, who it was issued by and the certificate’s period of validity.
 
These security measures are reviewed regularly in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.

## Sponsor Communications and Social Media
As a child-focused organisation, we are committed to the well-being of all family and newborn. While we are fully committed to making communicating with your sponsored newborn(s) as enjoyable and efficient as possible, our priority is to ensure their safety and privacy, as well as yours, are protected.
 
BreatheLife understands that we cannot prevent sponsors from connecting with their sponsored newborn(s) through various social media sites; however, we do ask that you consider the following before you engage in such communication:
 
- Understand, identify, and manage potential risks of social media engagement
- Understand and recognise acceptable and inappropriate behaviour and communications
- Understand the available reporting mechanisms for when you feel uncomfortable, as well as the potential consequences of unacceptable behaviour
 
In addition, here are some posting guidelines so that you, as partners of BreatheLife, can help ensure that your sponsored newborns’ safety will not be compromised: 
 
- Please only use the first name of your sponsored child
- Please do not post your sponsored child's ID number
- Please ensure that the photos you post are appropriate and that your sponsored child is adequately clothed. Photos should not be geo-tagged and wherever possible, measures should be taken to prevent electronic copying of photographs
- Please do not publish identifying or private information about the newborn or family (e.g. the name of the exact location where he or she lives)
 
We appreciate your support and understanding in protecting the safety of your sponsored child. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at (6017) 413 0454.
